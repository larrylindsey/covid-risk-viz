      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
      I started this project after I went looking for answer to the
      question of, basically, what the risk of catching COVID-19 is out in
      the world. There are plenty of sources for the daily confirmed case 
      count, but testing in the United States is not common or consistent
      enough for this alone to be a useful indicator. The fatality count,
      while not fool-proof, is more reliable, and can be used to back-solve 
      for at least an estimate of what the actual case count would have been
      when those who die of this disease likely caught it.
      </p>
      <p>
      The purpose of this site is to get an idea of what the case rate is
      in a given county or equivalent. <b>I use a lot of hand-wavy
      approximations here</b>, so these estimates are probably wrong by
      somewhere between a little and a lot. In other words, I don't 
      recommend using this for instance to make any important life
      decisions.

          <h4>Estimating the COVID-19 Case Rate</h4>
          <p>
          By "case rate", I mean the fraction of people who have an actively
          contagious case of the disease. For instance, if 100 people are
          able the spread the disease in a county with a population of 100,000,
          then the case rate there is 0.1 percent. This is related to, but not
          exactly, the probability that any given person you might meet could
          transmit the disease to you.
          </p>
          <p>
          To make this estimate, I back-compute the daily case count from the
          fatality count, then for each day, I sum the number of likely active
          cases within a "contagious window" to figure out the total
          number of actively contagious infections. Dividing by the county
          population yields the active case rate.
          </p>
          <p>
          To back-compute daily cases from daily fatalities, I guess a
          distribution of when each person who died from covid likely caught
          the disease, then divide by the fatality rate (also a guess) to get
          an estimate of what the actual daily case count was on those days.
          </p>
          <h5>Backsolving Daily Cases from Mortality</h5>
          <p>
          An early
          <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30566-3/fulltext" target="_blank">
            publication in The Lancet
          </a>
          reported that the time from infection to death took on average 18.5 days with
          a mean-centered interquartile range (IQR) of 7 days (see the bottom
          of Table 2). By default, this site uses this to estimate a 
          distribution of infection dates corresponding to each fatality. These
          parameters may be adjusted below. It should be noted that the
          cases studied in this publication were all hospitalized patients,
          which probably introduces an unknown bias.
          </p>
          <p>
          Using a distribution in this way has some drawbacks. It
          will tend to smooth out "super-spreader" incidents, since we cannot
          tell when several fatalities are related to the same incident. The
          use of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation" target="_blank">
            cross-correlation
          </a>
          also limits the overall amount of time for which this back
          computation is valid. To mitigate these effects, setting the IQR
          to zero will result in a simple time-shift.

          <h5>Fatality Rate</h5>
          <p>
          The following parameters control the assumed fatality rate, or the
          fraction of people who, once infected, will eventually die. The rate
          changes with time, for instance as treatment becomes more effective,
          so we set an "early" rate and a "late" rate, as well as a transition
          day and an approximation for the number of days over which this
          transition may have occurred.

          <h5>Contagious Window</h5>
          <p>
          A person with an active infection will only be contagious for a
          certain number of days. This could either be because the virus is
          shed for only a subset of the infection time, or because of self
          isolation. The default is set to seven days, and this is mostly a
          guess. I was unable to find a reliable estimate for this number.
