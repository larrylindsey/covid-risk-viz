# Covid Risk Visualizations

This is a project I've been working on in some spare time to get a handle of
what the active covid case rate in a community is. The computations in here
rely on a handful of hard assumptions that are hard to verify, but I estimate
it to be within a factor 2 or 4 of the correct value. Still, I would not
recommend anyone use these results as "official" in any way, or to make any
important life decisions based on them.


Currently attempting to get gh-pages working...
