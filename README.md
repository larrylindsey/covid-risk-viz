# Covid Risk Visualizations

This is a project I've been working on in some spare time to get a handle of
what the active covid case rate in a community is. The computations in here
rely on a handful of hard assumptions that are hard to verify, so I would not
recommend anyone use these numbers to make any important life decisions.

Graphs can be viewed [here](https://larrylindsey.github.io/covid-risk-viz/).


Things that are left to do:

* Fiddle with chart visuals - markers, colors, etc.
* Finish data update script to make it easy to cron.
* Add comments to uncommented code.
